# language-tools

A C library for creating programming languages.

## Code generation

The library generates code for lexers, parsers, and semantic analyzers through [bazel](https://bazel.build) rules.

An example toy LISP cli using this library can be found [here](https://github.com/jeffreymanzione/language-tools/tree/main/examples/lisp).
